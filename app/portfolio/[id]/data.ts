      "details": "In the first approach, clients were distinctly categorized as individuals or restaurants, enabling the platform to tailor supply chains to meet the unique needs of each group effectively. Alternatively, the platform also supported a dynamic ordering system without strict client categorization, allowing both individuals and restaurants to order ingredients as needed."
