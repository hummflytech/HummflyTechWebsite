    description:
    `This project develops an advanced AI-driven solution for plant disease detection using 
    a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately classify plant diseases. 
    The process involves training the AI model with a curated dataset of plant images, optimizing 
    it for high classification accuracy, and then deploying the trained model in a Flask-based application
     with a simple, user-friendly web interface. By combining robust AI techniques with practical 
     deployment strategies, the project demonstrates how cutting-edge technology can address
      critical agricultural challenges, offering scalable and efficient plant health diagnostics solutions.
